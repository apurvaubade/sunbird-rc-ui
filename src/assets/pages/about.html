                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Government’s “eLocker Initiative” complements the Sri Lanka Unique Digital Identity (SLUDI) program, by allowing citizens to manage authenticated documents that can carry specific personal information about themselves, for them to avail any specific
                        Government/Private sector services or benefits. These documents can be validated and confirmed by entities (or requesting organisations) that have the authority to ascertain such information, and require this authentication mechanism
                        to provision the requested service or benefits to the citizens. Such authenticated documents are called digital credentials or certificates - which are tamper-proof, digitally signed and offline-verifiable. Examples of such digital
                        credentials include the National identity documents issued by SLUDI (or NIC), Educational certificates, Driving licences, Taxpayer certificates, Confirmation of Mobile Number Ownership and many more. The eLocker Initiative is aimed
                        at serving three primary actors, namely; Citizens - who are the holders of the credentials; Issuers - the credential issuing institutions; and the Verifiers - the institutions that use the credentials to serve citizens. The core
                        objective of the eLocker Initiative is to facilitate seamless consent-based sharing of trusted and verified information between the Citizens, Government and Private sector institutions for the fulfilment of various Citizen-requested
                        transactions, while ensuring complete privacy and security of the Citizen’s data.

                                    Trust framework specifies the governance and technical specifications that inject trust into the credential ecosystem that includes issuers, holders and verifiers. Creates technical and human/organisation level trust

                        The rolling out of the eLocker platform is being done in alignment with the Government of Sri Lanka’s Digital Government Strategy 2020-2024. This goes hand-in-hand with the SLUDI initiative, which provides all Sri Lankans with a biometric-enabled unique
                        Digital Identity. To aid this vision, the eLocker platform has used the open-source “Sunbird-RC” digital credentialing platform, as the core technology foundation.
                        <br> ICTA has taken steps to launch the eLocker platform, in synchronisation with the Pilot launch of SLUDI in the country. As part of the 1st release of the eLocker, the citizens will have the ability to fetch and maintain their
                        SLUDI identity and COVID-Vaccination certificates as well as scanned copies of other Government documents, in their eLocker Wallet. Supporting other forms of Government and Private sector digital credentials in the eLocker, will
                        be rolled out in due course. The eLocker platform will also provide various Government departments an ability to issue tamper-proof, digitally signed documents for various transactions, in the future.
